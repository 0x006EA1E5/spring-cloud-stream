Thanks for considering raising a Spring Cloud Stream issue. Please take the time to review the following categories as some of them do not apply here.

ðŸ™… "Please DO NOT Raise an Issue" Cases
- Question
STOP!! Please ask questions about how to use something, or to understand why something isn't
working as you expect it to, on Stack Overflow using the spring-boot tag.
- Security Vulnerability
STOP!! Please don't raise security vulnerabilities here. Head over to https://pivotal.io/security to learn how to disclose them responsibly.
- Managed Dependency Upgrade
You DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release. BUT pull requests for upgrades that are more involved than just a version property change are still most welcome.
- With an Immediate Pull Request
An issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.

If your case does not match any of he above categories. . .
