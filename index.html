{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservices. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create DevOps friendly microservice applications and Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. Spring Cloud Stream provides an opinionated configuration of message brokers, introducing the concepts of persistent pub/sub semantics, consumer groups and partitions across several middleware vendors. This opinionated configuration provides the basis to create stream processing applications.

By adding `@EnableBinding` to your main application, you get immediate connectivity to a message broker and by adding `@StreamListener` to a method, you will receive events for stream processing.

As long as Spring Cloud Stream and a Spring Cloud Stream Binder dependencies are on the classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableBinding` will bind to the external message broker (e.g. Rabbit MQ or Apache Kafka, depending on the binder-implementation of choice).

Let's see it in action!

Head over to http://start.spring.io and create a project with the 'Stream Kafka' dependency. Modify the main class as shown below:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class StreamdemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(StreamdemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT)
    public MessageSource<String> timerMessageSource() {
        return () -> new GenericMessage<>(new SimpleDateFormat().format(new Date()));
    }

}
```

Make sure Kafka is running when you run the application. You can use the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` utility provided by Kafka to monitor messages sent on the `output` topic.
